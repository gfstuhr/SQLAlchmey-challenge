# SQLAlchmey-challenge
 This challenge utilized the SQLAlchemy to make queries to an SQLite file from a Jupyter Notebook. Using the queried data, an analysis on the climate was performed, measuring precipitation and temperature.

The final step of this challenge was to load the data into an API App, using the Flask module. Using Flask, the data was converted to JSON format and loaded into several endpoints. If deployed to a live server, this would function as an callable API.
